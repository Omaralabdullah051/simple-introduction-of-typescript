//What is typeScript?
//Superset of javaScript created by microsoft
//Allows static strict typing
//Extra features -interfaces,enums,tuples,generics
//Supports modern features (arrow functions,let,const)
//Based on the .NET harmony specification

//TypeScript is a strict syntactical superset of javaScript and adds optional static typing to the language that designed by Microsoft for the development of large application and transcompiles to javaScript.

//What's wrong with javaScript?
//Not suitable for large applications
//Lacks strong typing
//Weird inheritance, unfamiliar syntax
//Only errors during runtime
//suffers type coercion

//TypeScript = Javascript (if we know javascript,we can work on typeScript)
//Transcompiles to Javascript (so it will run everywhere)
//Familiar with Object Oriented Programming
//New Features work everywhere
//error shows before compile

//Installation:
//1.firstly,we need to do install node.js.
//2.secondly,go in terminal or cmd and type the command npm i -g typescript
